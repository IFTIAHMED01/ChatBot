# Creating-my-personal-website
# So, you can access my website at: <a>https://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~ia18ka/A5/index.html</a>
 So, I developed the front-end of my website using HTML,CSS and JavaScript languages. I developed the back-end of my website using Python Programming language.</br>
 The aim of creating this personal website to give people some insight about my educational background, my hobbies and some of the courses and projects I have done in my life.</br>
 So, in my CSV file(Database.csv), I have stored <b>‘eri’</b> as my username and <b>‘12345678’</b> as my 
password. <b>So, inorder to access my Past Projects page, you need to give ‘eri’ as the username and
‘12345678’ as the password.</b>
